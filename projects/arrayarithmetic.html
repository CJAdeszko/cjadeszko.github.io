      <div class="project-info">
        <h2 class="sm-heading text-secondary">Purpose</h2>
        <p>
        Array_Arithmetic was created as a part of the Open-Source Apprenticeship portion of the Bloc Software Developer curriculum. After using open-source
        technologies in many of my projects, I was tasked with creating an open-source project of my own. During my tenure with Bloc, I was exposed to
        many Rubygems through the various projects (Devise, Faker, Bootstrap, Rspec, bcrypt, etc.) - so when it came time to create an open-source project, I decided
        to create a Rubygem of my own. The project was focused more on learning about the open-source community and it's processes than creating the next big thing
        in technology. The result of the project is a simple gem that provides users with a set of reusable methods for performing common mathematical operations
        on arrays of varied lengths. It's not an Earth-shattering development, but it did provide a freeform project for me to experience the open-source community
        and distribute my first Rubygem.
        </p>

        <h2 class="sm-heading text-secondary">Implementation</h2>
        <p>
        Array_Arithmetic was entirely implemented in Ruby as it provided useful methods for working with arrays and because I appreciate the
        symantic characteristics of the Ruby language. It also utilized Rspec for testing the provided methods and integration testing with Travis CI.
