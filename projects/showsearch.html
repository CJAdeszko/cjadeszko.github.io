        <h2 class="sm-heading text-secondary">Purpose</h2>
        <p>
        ShowSearch was created as a part of the final certification process of the Bloc Software Developer curriculum. To replicate
        the technical interview process, I was given one week to design and implement a web application based on a set of technical and
        functional requirements outlined by Bloc. At the end of the week, I would present my application in it's final state, functional or not,
        and be evaluated by a professional software developer on my implementation. The task was to create a TV show discovery application
        using the open-source TMDb API. Some of the basic requirements for the project included:
        <ul>
          <li>Create a full-stack application with a backend that communicates with the movie API.</li>
          <li>The front-end should be intuitive to use.</li>
          <li>Accompany the code with a full test suite.</li>
          <li>Deploy the site to a web host.</li>
          <li>When first loaded, there should be a list of popular TV shows and a search bar.</li>
          <li>Upon searching for a TV show in the search bar, the user should see a list of shows whose title matches the search.</li>
          <li>After clicking on a TV show, the user should be taken to a page with more information about that particular TV show.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h2 class="sm-heading text-secondary">Implementation</h2>
        <p>
          The application was required to be "full-stack", so I opted to implement it using Ruby on Rails without the use of ActiveRecord because
          no database actions were necessary since all movie data was being fetched from the TMDb API. The back-end is coded in Ruby and uses the HTTParty Rubygem
          to help fetch data from the API. The front-end was styled with a combination of MaterializeCSS and custom CSS.
